# FA-2-RegExp-Converter
This is a Python 2.7 program which will convert a finite automata in a regular expression.
The GUI used in this program is created by the Python library, Tkinter.
To run, simply download Python 2.7 and execute the prgm_runner.py code (errors will occur if using Python 3.x).

#Notes
This program certainly works with Deterministic Finit Automatas (DFA), but is untested for Nondeterministic FAs (NFA). The capacity for it has been implemented.
